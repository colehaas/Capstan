# Capstan
chess engine in C

## current state
The engine can accurately go through the perft.txt file, although quite slowly.

## roadmap/todo
- could make gamelist just have a pointer to the previous gamelist
  - essentially an only backwards reversed list

- implement alpha beta search

- add initial move ordering

- implement zorbist hashing
